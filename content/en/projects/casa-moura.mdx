<Title>Application flow</Title>

The main flow follows the user journey in an e-commerce store:

1. **Navigation and product search**

   - The user accesses the home page and views the products.
   - You can filter or search by name.

2. **🛒 Shopping cart**

   - The user adds products to the cart.
   - The cart is persisted (even after reloading the page).
   - It is possible to increase/decrease quantity or remove items.

3. **🔑 Authentication**

   - To complete the purchase, the user must be authenticated.
   - Login/registration is done via Firebase Authentication (email/password).
   - After authentication, the user returns to the checkout flow.

4. **💳 Checkout and payment**

   - At checkout, the system calculates the total.
   - Integration with **Mercado Pago Transparent Checkout** processes the payment without redirecting the user.

5. **✅ Order confirmation**
   - The order is registered in the **Firestore**.
   - The user receives visual feedback on the payment status (approved, pending or declined).
