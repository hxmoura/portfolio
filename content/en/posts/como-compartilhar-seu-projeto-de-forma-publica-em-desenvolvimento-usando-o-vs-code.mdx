VS Code holds secrets that few people know about, one of which is the function of exposing your project publicly without having to host it on cloud services (port forwarding).

This feature is useful for showing your project to other team members or clients. For security reasons, it should only be used for development, here's how to do it:

1.  Press **CTRL + Quotation marks ( ' )** on your keyboard and access the "Ports" tab.

    <ImageView imageUrl="/vs01.webp" />
    <Spacer height={36} />

2.  Click on the "Forward a port" button and enter the port your project is running on.

    <ImageView imageUrl="/vs02.webp" />
    <Spacer height={36} />

3.  You will receive an access link, but it is still private (only you can access it). To allow public access, right-click on **"Private"**. Change the Port visibility to **"Public"**.
    <ImageView imageUrl="/vs03.webp" />
    <Spacer height={36} />

That's it! You'll have your project publicly available and easily accessible, just copy the link and share it with your team.

**Notes

- When you do the process for the first time, you'll need to authenticate with Github
- In order for the link to be available, the project must be running on your machine on the same port as that specified in the share.
