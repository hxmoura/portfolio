I started programming in 2017, at the age of 16, casually creating a GTA Online server â€” a modified version of the game that allows new features to be implemented through coding.

The project grew beyond expectations, becoming one of the top 5 servers in Brazil and almost turning into a small business, where I learned skills beyond coding, such as management and sales, reaching over 300 active users and more than 4,000 registrations.

In 2022, I sold the server and began studying programming in a more structured way, creating practical and challenging projects such as FanPix, Casa Moura, and Foodiary, where I was able to deepen my knowledge of React, TypeScript, and coding best practices.

More recently, in March 2025, I started as a front-end volunteer at Turismendes, a project that uses QR Codes at strategic points to promote tourism in the city of Mendes/RJ.

Today, my focus is on building complete and functional applications, understanding not only the code but also the business perspective and the user experience.
