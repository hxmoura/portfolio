I started programming in 2017, at the age of 16, in an unpretentious way, creating
a GTA Online server - a modified version of the game that allows you to create
new features using programming.

The project grew beyond expectations, becoming one of the 5 largest servers
in Brazil, becoming almost a small business, where I learned skills beyond coding,
such as management and sales, reaching +300 active users and +4mil registrations.

In 2022, I sold the server and began to study programming in a more
structured way, creating practical and challenging projects such as <CustomLink noAnimation href="/project/turismendes">Turismendes</CustomLink> and Foodiary, where I was able to learn more about React,
TypeScript and good coding practices.

More recently, in March 2025, I started as a front-end volunteer at
Turismendes, a project that uses QR Codes at strategic points to promote tourism in the city of
tourism in the city of Mendes/RJ.

Today, my focus is on building complete and functional applications, including
not only the code, but also the business vision and user experience.
